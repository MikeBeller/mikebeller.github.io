## My (Tech) Interests

* Low latency, highly scalable, high reliability systems
* Information security
* Innovative networks
* Internet of Things

## My Background

* I am an engineer by training, and by outlook
* I studied Electrical Engineering at Cornell University and then Columbia University in the 1980's
* I started my career as an engineer at Bell Communications Research, where I worked on communications protocols, mobile communications, and helped invent cryptographic protocols for securing mobile phones
* I co-founded a mobile computing technology company in the mid 1990's called PenVision
* I spent most of the recent 20 years of my life working in Financial Technology and Financial services, a company called Tradeworx (and later Thesys), where I began as CTO and then ultimately became CEO.
* At Tradeworx I architected, developed, and operated electronic trading systems that traded billions of dollars of stock trades per day, processing millions of messages per second, and responding to market events within microseconds.
* I also architected hugely scalable big-data databases of financial data, including the MIDAS system which is used by the SEC to monitor the markets, and the original Consolidated Audit Trail system -- systems which process > 100 Billion messages per day, and require intense information security.
