## Tech I Find Interesting

* Lately I've been spending a lot of time with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), which is based on the Erlang virtual machine.  My work on High Frequency Trading in the 2000's was influenced heavily by my study of [Erlang](https://erlang.org/) at that time. While Erlang was simply way too slow to handle the microsecond level performance we needed (C/C++ was the only choice at the time), nonetheless the approach of using message-passing concurrency, which I learned to love from "Programming Erlang" by Joe Armstrong, was one important key to our success.
* The [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  Sometimes you need CPU performance.  Rust is the first language to achieve the performance of C / C++ without the attendant memory safety issues.  Adoption of Rust in systems programming (and embedded!) would have a major positive effect on information security. And it's [starting to happen](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/google-is-now-writing-low-level-android-code-in-rust/).  By the way I'm not very good at writing Rust code.  Still fighting with the borrow checker.
* Almost anything by [Fabrice Bellard](https://bellard.org/).  The TCC Tiny C Compiler, Qemu, Libbf, QuickJS.  He makes small things that are incredibly powerful.
* Speaking of small things -- the [Janet Programming Language](https://janet-lang.org/) is a very small, embeddable lisp-like language originated by [Calvin Rose](https://github.com/bakpakin).
* [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) --  [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/), creator of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is leading a project to create standard API's for in-memory storage, transport, and processing of column-oriented data. Combine this with [Optane](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-optane-technology.html) and I think you can begin to see the future.
* [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/).  I'm becoming an Adafruit junky. The ecosystem for embedded computing is blowing open -- and you can program a $5 microcontroller in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/).  I think the ease and low cost with which anyone with a small amount of programming experience can become a "maker" of cool automated real-world tech will lead to a revolution in embedded devices similar to the way Open Source caused a revolution in the 90's-2000's.  Someone tell [Lady Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limor_Fried) I am a big fan.
